## The learning objective of this project are

- Create react front end app
- Connect react front end app to rails back end
- Use API end point to get data
- Fetch data from the API

## Built With

- React
- Redux
- Materia UI

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#prerequisites)

### Setup

- ```git clone git@github.com:medaminedev66/lunar-hotel-frontend.git```

- ```cd code-buddy-frontend```

### Running The App Locally

- Run `npm install`

- Make sure to run our [Rails backend application](https://github.com/medaminedev66/lunar-hotel-backend) first before running the React app so that it takes up the `port 3000`. This is very important as our rails API end point must run on `port 3000` for the API to work.
- Once the back end is runing on `port 3000` then start the react app and you will be prompted to run the server on another port like `port 3001`. You will receive a message in your terminal like this `Would you like to run the app on another port instead? ¬ª (Y/n)`. Please enter `y` so that the react app will start on `port 3001`.
